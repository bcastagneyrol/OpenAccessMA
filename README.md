# On the epistemic impact of Open Access publishing in ecology and evolution

*Abstract* -- There are many goods reasons to support and promote an open access (OA) to scientific publications. Over the last decade several OA economic models developed, from diamond OA (free to publish, free to read) to gold OA (free to read, authors paying for article publication charges) or hybrid OA such that authors pay to make their article freely available in a subscription based journal. 

We hypothesize that the the strength of ecological evidence that are published in scientific articles is not independent from the publishing model. Specifically, we predict that effect sizes published in gold OA journals are weaker and more variable than those published in hybrid or subscription based journals. Conversely, we predict that effect sizes reported in OA articles published in hybrid journals are larger than those published in articles only accessible to subscribers when published in the same journals and issues. Should these predictions be correct, then the  type of OA articles would influence the outcomes of meta-analyses synthesizing current knowledge in ecology.  

We will test these hypotheses using a meta-analysis of recent meta-analyses published in the field of ecology, using the OA status of primary studies included in published meta-analyses as a new moderator. By doing so, our study will provide important — relieving or alarming — insights into research synthesis.
